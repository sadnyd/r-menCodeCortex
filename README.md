# Chiller Load Prediction Data

This dataset contains various parameters associated with monitoring and managing a chiller system, which is essential for optimizing cooling performance, energy efficiency, and overall system reliability.

## Data Fields Description:

1. **Time**:  
   The timestamp of when the data was recorded, which helps in tracking the performance of the chiller over time.

2. **RT (Refrigeration Tons)**:  
   Represents the total cooling capacity (in tons) that the chiller is providing at the time of recording.

3. **kW_Tot**:  
   Total electrical power consumption (in kilowatts) for the entire chiller system. It represents the sum of energy consumption by all components of the system.

4. **kW_RT**:  
   Real-time power consumption (in kilowatts) of the chiller at the exact moment of data recording.

5. **CH Load**:  
   The current cooling load placed on the chiller system, often expressed in terms of tons or a percentage of the chiller’s maximum capacity.

6. **kW_CHH (Chiller Heat Pump)**:  
   Kilowatt consumption by the chiller heat pump, a component responsible for managing heat exchange in the system.

7. **kW_CHP (Primary Chiller Pump)**:  
   Power usage (in kilowatts) of the primary chiller pump, which circulates chilled water throughout the system.

8. **kW_CHS (Secondary Chiller System)**:  
   Power consumption by the secondary chiller system, such as additional pumps or secondary chillers that may assist in providing cooling.

9. **kW_CDS (Condenser System)**:  
   Energy consumption by the condenser system, which expels heat from the chiller into the atmosphere or another heat sink.

10. **kW_CT (Cooling Tower)**:  
    Kilowatt consumption by the cooling tower, which aids in dissipating heat from the system.

11. **GPM (Gallons Per Minute)**:  
    The flow rate of water, typically either chilled water or condenser water, circulated within the system.

12. **DeltaCHW (Chilled Water Differential Temperature)**:  
    The temperature difference between the chilled water supply (CHWS) and chilled water return (CHWR). This helps in determining the efficiency of the cooling process.

13. **CHWS (Chilled Water Supply Temperature)**:  
    The temperature of the chilled water being supplied to the system or process that needs cooling.

14. **CHWR (Chilled Water Return Temperature)**:  
    The temperature of the water returning to the chiller after absorbing heat from the system or space being cooled.

15. **DeltaCDW (Condenser Water Differential Temperature)**:  
    The temperature difference between the condenser water inlet and outlet. This helps in evaluating the performance of the condenser in rejecting heat.

16. **CDHI (Condenser High Inlet Temperature)**:  
    The temperature of water entering the condenser at the high-pressure side, which is important for assessing condenser load and efficiency.

17. **CDLO (Condenser Low Outlet Temperature)**:  
    The temperature of water leaving the condenser on the low-pressure side after it has absorbed heat from the refrigerant.

18. **WBT (Wet-Bulb Temperature)**:  
    The ambient wet-bulb temperature, which plays a critical role in assessing the efficiency of the cooling tower and overall system performance in rejecting heat.

19. **DeltaCT (Cooling Tower Temperature Differential)**:  
    The temperature difference between the water entering and exiting the cooling tower, used to evaluate the cooling tower's efficiency.

20. **Hz_CHP (Primary Chiller Pump Frequency)**:  
    The frequency (in Hertz) of the primary chiller pump, indicating the speed at which the pump is operating, particularly if controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD).

21. **Hz_CHS (Secondary Chiller System Frequency)**:  
    Frequency of the secondary chiller system components (like pumps or secondary chillers) driven by VFDs.

22. **Hz_CDS (Condenser System Frequency)**:  
    Frequency (in Hertz) of the condenser system, reflecting the speed of the condenser pumps or fans controlled by a VFD.

23. **Hz_CT (Cooling Tower Frequency)**:  
    Frequency (in Hertz) of the cooling tower fan motors, which could be controlled by VFDs.

24. **Precent_CH (Chiller Load Percentage)**:  
    The percentage of the chiller system’s total capacity that is currently in use. A measure of how much of the system’s potential is being utilized.

25. **Precent_CHP (Primary Chiller Pump Load Percentage)**:  
    The percentage load on the primary chiller pump, showing how much of its maximum capacity is being utilized.

26. **Precent_CDS (Condenser System Load Percentage)**:  
    The percentage of the condenser system’s capacity that is currently in use.

27. **Precent_CT (Cooling Tower Load Percentage)**:  
    The percentage load on the cooling tower, indicating how much of its total capacity is being utilized to reject heat from the system.

28. **RH [%] (Relative Humidity)**:  
    The percentage of relative humidity in the ambient air. This can affect cooling tower performance and overall system efficiency.

29. **Temperature [°C]**:  
    The ambient air temperature around the chiller or cooling tower. This influences the heat rejection process and overall system performance.

## Key Groupings:

- **Power (kW)**:  
  Metrics related to energy consumption by various components (chiller, pumps, condenser, cooling tower).
- **Temperature (CHWS, CHWR, CDHI, CDLO)**:  
  Measures critical temperature points across the chiller and condenser loops.
- **Flow (GPM)**:  
  Reflects the flow rate of water through the system, critical for cooling performance.
- **Delta Values (DeltaCHW, DeltaCDW, DeltaCT)**:  
  Indicates temperature differences across system components, used to evaluate efficiency.
- **Frequency (Hz)**:  
  Tracks the speed of pumps and fans driven by variable frequency drives (VFDs).
- **Load Percentage (Precent\_\*)**:  
  Reflects the percentage of each system’s capacity that is currently being used.
