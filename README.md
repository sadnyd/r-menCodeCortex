chiller load prediction

In the context of a chiller system, columns based on typical parameters used in monitoring and managing chillers:

1. **Time**: The timestamp indicating when the data was recorded. This is often used to track the performance of the chiller over time.

2. **RT**: This could refer to the total refrigeration capacity or tonnage in real-time (RT stands for Refrigeration Tons). It indicates the cooling capacity being provided by the chiller at that moment.

3. **kW_Tot**: Total electrical power consumption (in kilowatts) of the chiller system. This would represent the overall power drawn by all components of the system.

4. **kW_RT**: Real-time power consumption (in kilowatts) of the chiller. It reflects how much electrical energy the chiller is consuming at the given time.

5. **CH Load**: The cooling load on the chiller system. It indicates how much cooling is required by the system to meet demand, usually expressed in tons or as a percentage of capacity.

6. **CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4**: These could represent individual chillers or components of the chiller system. They may be binary (on/off) or represent operational statuses such as load percentages.

7. **kW_CHH**: Kilowatt consumption of the chiller heat pump (CHH). This could represent the power used by a heat pump in the chiller circuit.

8. **kW_CHP**: Kilowatt consumption of the primary chiller pump (CHP). This would track the energy usage of the primary pump responsible for circulating chilled water.

9. **kW_CHS**: Kilowatt consumption of the secondary chiller system (CHS). This could be the power drawn by secondary pumps or chillers working in the system.

10. **kW_CDS**: Kilowatt consumption of the condenser system (CDS). This tracks the energy usage of the condenser, which rejects heat from the chiller to the environment.

11. **kW_CT**: Kilowatt consumption of the cooling tower (CT). This reflects the power used by the cooling tower fans and water circulation systems.

12. **GPM**: Gallons per minute. This typically represents the flow rate of chilled water or condenser water in the system. It shows how much water is circulating through the system.

13. **DeltaCHW**: The temperature difference across the chilled water loop. This is the difference between the supply and return chilled water temperatures and is critical for evaluating system efficiency.

14. **CHWS**: Chilled water supply temperature. The temperature of the water leaving the chiller to cool the building or process.

15. **CHWR**: Chilled water return temperature. The temperature of the water returning to the chiller after being used to cool the space or process.

16. **DeltaCDW**: The temperature difference across the condenser water loop. This is the difference between the supply and return temperatures of the condenser water, indicating heat rejection efficiency.

17. **CDHI**: Condenser high inlet temperature. This represents the temperature of the water entering the condenser on the high-pressure side.

18. **CDLO**: Condenser low outlet temperature. This represents the temperature of the water leaving the condenser on the low-pressure side.

19. **WBT**: Wet-bulb temperature. The ambient wet-bulb temperature, often used to evaluate cooling tower performance and efficiency.

20. **DeltaCT**: The temperature difference across the cooling tower. This measures the efficiency of the cooling tower in rejecting heat.

21. **Hz_CHP**: Frequency (in Hertz) of the primary chiller pump (CHP). This could indicate the speed of the pump if it's controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD).

22. **Hz_CHS**: Frequency (in Hertz) of the secondary chiller system (CHS). Similar to Hz_CHP, this could reflect the speed of secondary pumps or chillers controlled by VFDs.

23. **Hz_CDS**: Frequency (in Hertz) of the condenser system (CDS), likely showing the speed of condenser pumps or fans driven by a VFD.

24. **Hz_CT**: Frequency (in Hertz) of the cooling tower (CT), indicating the speed of the cooling tower fan motors controlled by a VFD.

25. **Precent_CH**: The percentage load or capacity being used by the chiller system. This shows how much of the chiller's total capacity is currently in use.

26. **Precent_CHP**: The percentage load or capacity being used by the primary chiller pump (CHP). This shows how hard the primary pump is working relative to its maximum capacity.

27. **Precent_CDS**: The percentage load or capacity of the condenser system (CDS). This shows the condenser system's current load relative to its capacity.

28. **Precent_CT**: The percentage load or capacity of the cooling tower (CT). This shows how much of the cooling tower's capacity is being utilized.

### Summary of Key Groups:

- **Power (kW)**: Tracks the energy usage of various system components like chillers, pumps, condensers, and cooling towers.
- **Temperature (CHWS, CHWR, CDHI, CDLO)**: Monitors water temperatures in the chilled water and condenser water loops.
- **Flow (GPM)**: Measures water flow rate.
- **Delta Values (DeltaCHW, DeltaCDW, DeltaCT)**: Shows temperature differences across key components, critical for evaluating efficiency.
- **Frequency (Hz)**: Tracks the speed of VFD-driven components like pumps and fans.
- **Load Percentage (Precent\_\*)**: Reflects the systemâ€™s capacity usage in real-time.

These parameters help monitor and optimize chiller system performance, energy efficiency, and overall capacity utilization.
